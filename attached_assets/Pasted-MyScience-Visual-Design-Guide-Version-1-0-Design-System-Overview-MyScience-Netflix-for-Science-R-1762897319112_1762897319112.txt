MyScience Visual Design Guide

Version 1.0 – Design System Overview
MyScience: Netflix for Science Research
A platform where researchers discover, connect, and collaborate through an open, intelligent feed.

🧭 1. Design Language Overview

MyScience’s design is modern, fluid, and human. It rejects the sterile, institutional look of traditional journal sites.
It’s about curiosity, motion, and identity — giving researchers a digital home that feels alive and personal.

✦ Guiding Principles
Principle	Description
Human-first	Showcase the researcher, not the publication. Profiles and feeds are alive with discovery.
Minimal & intuitive	Every element earns its place. Use space, color, and typography thoughtfully.
Accessible by default	WCAG 2.2 AA minimum; clarity over complexity.
Emotionally intelligent	Subtle animation, warm highlights, approachable language.
Open & adaptive	Responsive, mobile-friendly, and easily integrated with open data sources.
🎨 2. Color System
Use	Hex	Description	Accessibility
Primary	#0078FF	Electric science blue – main action color	✅
Secondary	#FF4F81	Coral pink – highlights engagement, likes, badges	✅
Accent	#00E0A1	Bright green – progress, success, positive states	✅
Background (Light)	#F9FAFB	Neutral off-white – modern and readable	✅
Background (Dark)	#0F1117	Deep grey – dark mode equivalent	✅
Text (Light Mode)	#111827	Rich near-black for content	✅
Text (Dark Mode)	#E5E7EB	Muted white for readability	✅
Error/Alert	#E11D48	Accessible red for warnings	✅

Tip:
Use color sparingly to signal intent. MyScience should feel calm, with pops of vibrancy only where user attention is needed (calls to action, badges, or notifications).

✍️ 3. Typography
Fonts

Headings: Poppins
 — geometric, modern, approachable

Use weights 600–700

Body Text: Inter
 — digital-native, clean, easy to read

Use weights 400–500

Size hierarchy
Role	Example	Size
H1	“Discover research that moves you.”	2.25rem / 36px
H2	Section titles	1.5rem / 24px
H3	Subheadings / card titles	1.125rem / 18px
Body	Standard text	1rem / 16px
Small	Metadata, timestamps	0.875rem / 14px
Style notes

Line height: 1.5–1.75 for readability

Letter spacing: 0.01–0.03em

Avoid uppercase headings; prefer sentence case for warmth

Use bold only for emphasis, never as decoration

🧩 4. Components Overview
Component	Description	Visual Style
Feed Card	Displays research summary, image, and actions (like, cite, share)	Rounded corners (1rem), soft shadow, hover lift
Profile Card	Researcher avatar, name, field tags, engagement metrics	Minimal layout with gentle color accent
Navigation Bar	Top or side navigation, responsive collapse	Floating feel with subtle background blur
Action Button	Primary CTAs (e.g., “Follow”, “Share”, “Save”)	Blue primary background, white text, 8px padding
Badge Icon	Gamified identity (lifespan animal theme)	Minimal line art, animated transitions
💫 5. Motion & Interaction
Type	Example	Duration
Hover scale	Feed card subtly enlarges (scale 1.02)	150 ms
Fade-in	New content items appear	250 ms
Color shift	Button hover darkens slightly	100 ms
Modal slide	Dialogs enter from bottom or side	200 ms

Principle: Motion should guide attention, not distract.
Prefer micro-interactions that reward curiosity.

🌗 6. Accessibility Standards

WCAG 2.2 AA minimum

Minimum text size = 16 px

Keyboard navigable components

Focus indicators always visible

Sufficient color contrast verified by automated tools

Use aria-label for all icons

Accessibility is not optional — it’s part of the design language.

🧠 7. Personality Keywords

When unsure about a design choice, align it to these five words:

Keyword	Interpretation
Curious	Inspires exploration and connection
Clear	Intuitive to navigate and visually uncluttered
Connected	Emphasizes collaboration and community
Credible	Feels professional without being corporate
Playful	Injects lightness and joy into discovery
🧱 8. Implementation Hints (for Replit)

Use Tailwind CSS or CSS variables for consistency (--color-primary, --radius-card, etc.)

Set global styles for typography and background at root level

Keep components modular: /components/feedCard.js, /components/profileCard.js

Integrate Framer Motion
 if using React for easy micro-animations

Include both light/dark themes early to future-proof UI

🚀 9. Design Motto

“Science should look as exciting as discovery feels.”

MyScience is not a journal site.
It’s a social-discovery space where open research meets next-gen user experience.
